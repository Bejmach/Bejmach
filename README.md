## What projects I tried to do

- interpreted language in cpp(stopped on tokenizer)
- games in godot
- game in python(Not something Im proud of)
- Some rundom staff that were abandoned
## What I want to do in the future(programing)
- Game engine in cpp
- AI Vtuber like neuro sama(because I would be a bad streamer, so I need something to cary the streams)
- Games in some custom engine, or godot
## What Im intrested in
- Games

- AI(slightly, but even tho I want to like it, I just cant. It all seems kinda fake, when I know how it work. Just one giant program to find an average of something)
